to do


subplot these - done. not looking good skipping.
sort out idx

___
this 25:
	get border pts - done
	plot them - done
	make a voronoi - done
	plot it - done

this 25:
	figure out voronoi stuff - done
	figure out inside outside - done

this 25:
	test inside outside - done
	break up convex shape into triangles - done
	test inside outside with convex poly - done

this 25:
	find perpendicular bisector pts - done
	plot it - done
	find border pts by equidistant rule
	work out equation - done

	convert infinite lines into finite lines
	
		find pts of intersection of line and bounding box

	region list - pt., get line that is defined by pt and upcoming vor vert neighbor

this 25:
	get ridge list - done

this 25:
	make  class - done
	move functions - done
	get ridge lines - done
	plot - done

this 25:
	test more than 4 polylines
	convert lines in to polylines
	get neighborhood info

you can definitely do this

this 25:
	make sib - done
	plot - done
	do inside outside for non edge regions
		get polyline from region idx
		repeat last
		use conv function


this 25:
	get two points for pb - done

this 25:
	get polyline intersections - done
	get on line segment intersections - doen


later:
	if inside, give val of pt to sib point - done
